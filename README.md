# Airbnb-Analysis--EDA-and-Analysis-using-Tableau
# Problem Statement:
This project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends. 
# Approach:
# MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval: 
Establishing a connection to the MongoDB Atlas database and retrieve the Airbnb dataset. Performing queries and data retrieval operations to extract the necessary information for the analysis.
# Data Cleaning and Preparation: 
Cleaning the Airbnb dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types as necessary. Preparing the dataset for EDA and visualization tasks, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
# Price Analysis and Visualization: 
Using the cleaned data to analyze and visualize how prices vary across different locations, property types, and seasons. Creating dynamic plots and charts that enable users to explore price trends, outliers, and correlations with other variables.
# Dashboard Creation: 
Utilising Tableau to create a comprehensive dashboard that presents key insights from the analysis. 
# Libraries used:
* Plotly, Seaborn - Data visualization
* Pandas - Data Cleaning
* Pymongo - To store and retrieve the data by connecting with MongoDB Atlas
